# Brain Tumor Detection using deep learning model 
- The objective of the Brain Tumor Detection deep learning model is to accurately classify brain MRI images into two categories: "tumor" or "non-tumor."
- By utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the model aims to provide an automated and reliable solution for detecting the presence of brain tumors in medical imaging data.
